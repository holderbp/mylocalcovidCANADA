For the mylocalcovid app(s), I decided to follow the protocol outlined
in this canonical question/answer on serverfault.com:

https://serverfault.com/questions/357108

regarding setting permissions for web development and hosting.  To
wit:

* all users that are developers of the app should be members of the
  group dev-mlc.  That group will have read-write-execute permissions
  on all files for web hosting.

* Since the web-server user (here, nginx; sometimes, www-data) is a
  proxy for all external visitors to the site, its permissions are
  restricted to read-only (and executable for visiting directories),
  unless it needs write permissions for something (for this app, there
  is no "upload" options, so there is no need for write privileges).

* Therefore whenever changes are made to the server scripts (e.g.,
  when a git pull is run by a user), the script

./set_permissions_mylocalcovid <directory>

 (where <directory> is usually mylocalcovidCANADA), should be run to
 make the web-server user the *owner* of the portal files, but with
 fewer permissions than the dev-mlc group members (of which it is not
 a member).  The script executes the following commands:
  
sudo chown -R nginx canada_mylocalcovid
sudo chgrp -R dev-mlc canada_mylocalcovid
sudo chmod -R 460 canada_mylocalcovid
sudo chmod -R ug+X canada_mylocalcovid

* All of this is silly on such a small operation, but it sounds like
  best practice for the case where (i) not all developers are, or
  should be, root (ii) the web server user is given minimal privileges
  on the server to prevent external attack, and (iii) there are other
  users on the server who should be prevented from viewing of the
  server contents.
